    <hr>
    <p>Hi. My name is Ben Jarmon. I am a student at the University of Oregon, majoring in Business Administration. I am interested in the marketing side of business and making that my concentration. I am also currently I am taking a computer science class, learning how to code and make my very own website. My skills and knowledge in computer science have improved a lot from before this class.</p>
    <p>Outside of school I am very passionate about fashion, art and being creative in general. Whether it be designing clothes, figures, fine art, graphic design or anything like that. I would love to be a designer in the future, mainly in fashion, and be able to live my life creatively and in the way I envision my life to be.</p>
    <p>Other things I enjoy are sports like soccer and basketball. Both playing and watching are very fun for me. I also like to travel and hike. Even though I've only really gone hiking a few times, I'd love to do more of it in the future.</p>
