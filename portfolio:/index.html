      <h2>Louis Vuitton</h2>
      <p>Virgil Abloh was a big influence for street culture entering high fashion. As the first Black artistic director at the brand, he brought in hip-hop, skate, and contemporary art to create a new and unique style that represents his culture. This also left a deeper message about diversity and bringing more people in. After Virgil passed in 2021, the new and current director Pharrell Williams was brought in. Pharrell has always been in the rap and fashion scene, as a very well known producer and artist in the rap game, but also creating his own line HumanRace in the fashion industry. While people are still waiting for him to bring a style a bit more new and innovative to Louis Vuitton, he has been doing a pretty good job so far.</p>
